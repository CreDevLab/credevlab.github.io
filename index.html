<p>Credevlabz is a Creative Development Laboratory that aims to implement new ideas with every venture. 
We, at Credevlabz, develop websites for a better experience for the users. We strive to work with the 
latest technologies available and implement new ideas to explore every new dimension in web 
technology. The internet technology is as wide as anyone can imagine. A number of services, 
technologies and solutions are still unexplored, lying safely behind closed doors. Our focus is to knock 
down every door available to get the best out of it.
Our prime goal is to develop every project with a creative vision. Creativity is the key to the success and 
growth of any venture, since in this time of web optimization, what has been done once, is already a 100 
years old. Creativity cannot be limited and only sharing creative ideas with likeminded people is going to 
help all of us grow towards the collective dream making the web less mysterious. This is the reason why 
we are in favor of open source projects. Each one of our projects will be an open source forever, as open 
source technologies have helped us learn and explore the intricacies of web and we hope to return the 
favor. 
So feel free to access all these codes and we hope that this venture of ours will help you in your projects.</p>
