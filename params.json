{"name":"Creative Development Laboratory","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Credevlabz.\r\nCredevlabz is a Creative Development Laboratory that aims to implement new ideas with every venture. \r\nWe, at Credevlabz, develop websites for a better experience for the users. We strive to work with the \r\nlatest technologies available and implement new ideas to explore every new dimension in web \r\ntechnology. The internet technology is as wide as anyone can imagine. A number of services, \r\ntechnologies and solutions are still unexplored, lying safely behind closed doors. Our focus is to knock \r\ndown every door available to get the best out of it.\r\nOur prime goal is to develop every project with a creative vision. Creativity is the key to the success and \r\ngrowth of any venture, since in this time of web optimization, what has been done once, is already a 100 \r\nyears old. Creativity cannot be limited and only sharing creative ideas with likeminded people is going to \r\nhelp all of us grow towards the collective dream making the web less mysterious. This is the reason why \r\nwe are in favor of open source projects. Each one of our projects will be an open source forever, as open \r\nsource technologies have helped us learn and explore the intricacies of web and we hope to return the \r\nfavor. \r\nSo feel free to access all these codes and we hope that this venture of ours will help you in your projects.","google":"UA-69244521-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
